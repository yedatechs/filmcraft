# FilmCraft — rules for agents and contributors

These rules apply to every human and AI contributor. `CLAUDE.md` holds the working instructions; this
file holds the rules that must never be broken. When the two disagree, this file wins.

## 0. Never crash

People trust FilmCraft with hours of work. A malformed file, a bad command or MCP parameter, a corrupt
preset or project, an odd keystroke or a full disk must give an error the user (or agent) can act on,
never a crash and never lost work. **This rule outranks feature work:** don't ship a feature by adding a
panic path, and fix a crash before building on top of it. The cross-app standard is
[`craftrules/standards/never-crash.md`](https://github.com/storytold/craftrules/blob/main/standards/never-crash.md).

1. **Fail with `Result<T, E>`.** Return the crate's error type and propagate with `?`; add context
   (`map_err`, an error variant) instead of discarding it. In the UI, report the error (status bar, error
   dialog) and carry on.
2. **No panicking shortcuts outside tests:** no `unwrap()`, `expect()`, `panic!`, `unreachable!`, `todo!`
   or `unimplemented!`. Use `?`, `ok_or(..)?`, `let Some(x) = .. else { return Err(..) }`, `if let`, or a
   fallback that is truly correct (never one that silently corrupts a project). An unfinished feature
   returns an "unsupported" error. The only exception is a call that is provably infallible from local
   code alone (a literal that always parses): a single-item `#[allow(clippy::expect_used)]` with the reason.
3. **No `unsafe`** (`unsafe_code = "forbid"` for the workspace). The single exception is
   `crates/platform`, which needs `unsafe` to call the operating system's media APIs (hardware
   video decoding through VideoToolbox and Media Foundation / Direct3D 11, hardware encoding, and OS
   media capture of the screen and cameras for recording: [ADR 0002](docs/adr/0002-platform-capture-ffi.md))
   and does nothing else. It
   uses `unsafe_code = "deny"` with `#[allow(unsafe_code)]` only on its FFI modules, a
   `// SAFETY:` comment on every `unsafe` block, a safe `Result`-returning public API, and the
   pure-Rust decoder as the tested fallback ([ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-platform-ffi.md)).
4. **Every input-derived number is hostile.** Media files, project and interchange files, presets, fonts,
   CLI / MCP / control-channel parameters and UI state are untrusted. Index and slice with `get()` (or
   validate bounds once, up front, for a hot loop); slice strings only at char boundaries; use
   `checked_*` / `saturating_*` for lengths, offsets and counts; never divide by a value that can be zero
   (frame rates, timescales, sample rates, sizes); don't cast negative or NaN values to integers; don't
   call `clamp` with bounds that can cross; cap allocations sized by input.
5. **Bound recursion and loops.** Projects can be cyclic (nested sequences) or deeply nested: walk them
   with seen-sets or depth limits.
6. **Don't cascade.** Lock poisoning is not fatal: `lock().unwrap_or_else(PoisonError::into_inner)`.
   Every thread or job (export, previews, proxies, decoding workers…) runs under `catch_unwind` and
   reports a failure as an error: a dead worker leaves monitors blank or jobs "running" forever.
7. **Last-resort guard.** The panic hook (`crates/ui-egui/src/crash.rs`) logs every panic, and the UI pass
   runs under `catch_unwind`, so an escaped panic becomes an error window and the session (and unsaved
   project) survives. It is a safety net, not a substitute for rules 1–6. Keep `panic = "unwind"`.
8. **Prove it.** Every crash fix comes with a small synthetic regression test that panicked before the
   fix. Parsers and decoders get mutation-fuzz tests (truncation, bit flips, corrupt sizes) run under
   `catch_unwind`; new commands get hostile-parameter tests. Fuzzer findings become tests.
9. **Enforced:** clean crates carry `#![deny(clippy::unwrap_used, clippy::expect_used, clippy::panic,
   clippy::unimplemented, clippy::todo, clippy::unreachable)]` (moving to `[workspace.lints.clippy]` once
   every crate is clean). `clippy.toml` allows them in tests: a failing test should fail loudly.

## 1. Assets: no Adobe artwork, every asset licensed and attributed

This rule is absolute. Breaking it is the most serious mistake a contributor can make on this project.

**What counts as an asset:** any image, icon, cursor, logo, illustration, screenshot, font, colour LUT,
preset, template, sound, music, video, 3D model, or other non-code media. This covers files in the
repository, bytes embedded in code (`include_bytes!`, base64, data URIs), and data hard-coded to
reproduce an image (for example, point lists traced from someone else's icon).

1. **Never use Adobe iconography, images or other Adobe assets**, in any form:
   - no icons, cursors, logos, splash screens, UI artwork or screenshots from any Adobe product;
   - no Adobe fonts, LUTs, presets, templates, sound effects, stock media or sample projects;
   - no traced, redrawn, recoloured or "inspired-by" copies of Adobe icons. Our icons may follow generic
     conventions (a play triangle, a razor blade, a stopwatch), but each must be drawn from scratch
     without reference to Adobe's artwork.
2. **Every asset must be open**: open-source licensed (MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD, ISC, zlib, SIL OFL…),
   public domain / CC0, or Creative Commons (CC BY or CC BY-SA; no NC/ND licences), **or** created by a
   contributor who owns it and licenses it to the project under the project licence (MIT OR Apache-2.0).
   If the licence is unknown or unclear, the asset does not go in.
3. **Every asset needs an attribution sidecar.** Next to each asset file `X`, add `X.attribution` with:
   ```text
   asset:        <file name>
   title:        <what it is>
   author:       <creator / copyright holder>
   source:       <URL, or "original work" for contributor-made assets>
   license:      <SPDX id or licence name>
   license-file: <path to the licence text, if the licence requires shipping it>
   added:        <YYYY-MM-DD> by <contributor>
   notes:        <how it was made or modified; for screenshots, what is shown>
   ```
   Also add one line for the asset to [`ATTRIBUTION.md`](ATTRIBUTION.md). `cargo xtask assets` (part of
   `cargo xtask ci`) fails if any asset lacks a sidecar or index entry.
4. **Screenshots** in the repo may show only FilmCraft (or other open projects), with media we generated
   or media that is itself openly licensed. Never commit screenshots of Adobe products.
5. **Local reference material stays local.** Premiere reference screenshots and notes live only in
   `plan/premiere/` (gitignored). They must never be committed, bundled, embedded, traced or shipped.
6. **Code-drawn assets** (icons in `crates/ui-egui/src/icons.rs`, procedural demo footage in
   `crates/media`, procedural looks in `crates/render`) are original work under the project licence
   and are listed in `ATTRIBUTION.md`.
7. **When in doubt, leave it out** and draw or generate it yourself.
8. **The one exception: first-party ArtCraft brand marks.** The ArtCraft name and logos in `docs/brand/`
   are trademarks of the ArtCraft Team, not open source, usable only unmodified and only in the context of
   FilmCraft under `docs/brand/LICENSE-brand.txt`; forks and modified versions must remove them. They still
   need a sidecar and an `ATTRIBUTION.md` row (licence `LicenseRef-ArtCraft-Trademark`). No other
   non-open asset is allowed, and this exception never covers third-party marks (Adobe, Discord, GitHub
   and other logos stay out; draw a generic icon instead).
9. **Fonts live in [storytold/craft-fonts](https://github.com/storytold/craft-fonts), never in this
   repo.** Don't commit new font files (the small Latin UI fonts already in `assets/fonts/` stay). A
   font FilmCraft needs is added to craft-fonts, which the app reads through the optional build input
   `CRAFT_FONTS_DIR=<absolute path of a craft-fonts checkout>` (`crates/text/build.rs` embeds the fonts in its
   `fonts/manifest.txt` as `filmcraft_text::fonts::CRAFT_FONTS`; unset, it is empty and the app uses its
   bundled and system fonts). Never add craft-fonts to a `Cargo.toml`. Code using `CRAFT_FONTS` must work
   when it is empty. Standard: [`craftrules/standards/fonts.md`](https://github.com/storytold/craftrules/blob/main/standards/fonts.md).

## 2. Clean-room code

- Never read, disassemble or copy anything inside Adobe application bundles; file names and listings only.
  Observe behaviour by using the app; never capture its Home screen, recent projects, account info or
  file browsers.
- Never copy GPL/LGPL/AGPL code (FFmpeg, x264, x265, MLT, Kdenlive, Shotcut, Olive, LAME…).
- Implement codecs and formats from public specifications (ITU-T/ISO/IEC standards, IETF RFCs, the VP9
  and AV1 bitstream specs, SMPTE documents, published container specs). Do not read the source of
  reference or third-party decoders/encoders while implementing a format, even permissively licensed
  ones (libvpx, libopus, libaom, dav1d, openh264…); spec text and conformance vectors only. Record the
  spec edition used in the crate README.
- ffmpeg/ffprobe may be used only as external test oracles and fixture generators. They are never
  linked, bundled or shipped.
- Dependencies must use permissive licences: MIT/Apache-2.0/BSD/ISC/Zlib/Unicode/CC0/BSL-1.0, or
  MPL-2.0 used unmodified.

## 3. Engineering rules

### 3.1 Never crash

See [§0](#0-never-crash). It outranks every other engineering rule.

### 3.2 The rest

See `CLAUDE.md`: pure Rust, dependency layering (`cargo xtask layers`), exact `Tick` time, everything is
a command, everything is agent-drivable, and the quality gates (`cargo xtask ci`) before every commit.


Shared real-file test corpora (Photoshop-authored PSDs, etc.) live in
[`storytold/photocraft-corpus`](https://github.com/storytold/photocraft-corpus), explained in
[craftrules `standards/test-corpora.md`](https://github.com/storytold/craftrules/blob/main/standards/test-corpora.md).
Never commit large binary fixtures to this repo; fetch them pinned by commit and sha256-verified,
as PhotoCraft does with `cargo xtask corpus`.

## Contributor credits (About window)

- About ▸ Contributors/Models are compiled into the binary from `contributors/contributors.json`
  (commit stats; generated, never hand-edit) and `contributors/people.toml` (names people chose for
  themselves). See `docs/contributors.md`.
- **Agents working for a contributor:** when you prepare a PR, check whether your human's GitHub
  username has a `[people.<username>]` entry in `contributors/people.toml`. If not, ask them once
  whether they want to be credited by more than their username: a real name, a display name, and/or
  their public GitHub profile name (`sync_github_name = true`). If yes, add **only their own** entry
  (copy the template at the top of the file, or run
  `python3 ../../craftrules/scripts/contributors.py --add-me . --real-name "…" --sync-github-name`)
  and include it in their PR, committed as them. If no, change nothing: they are credited as
  `@username` anyway.
- Never add, edit, guess or copy anyone else's entry or name (not from git config, commit authors or
  GitHub profiles). Never hand-edit `contributors.json`.
- Maintainers refresh the stats with `python3 ../../craftrules/scripts/contributors.py .` (it also
  re-verifies who wrote each `people.toml` entry; `--check` only verifies).

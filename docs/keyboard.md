# Keyboard parity with Premiere Pro

FilmCraft's **Premiere Pro Compatible** shortcut preset (Edit ▸ Keyboard Shortcuts…) follows
Premiere's default keyboard (macOS). The table lives in `crates/engine/src/shortcut_presets.rs`:
`PREMIERE` (application-wide keys and a few panel keys) and `PREMIERE_PANEL` (panel-scoped keys
that FilmCraft Default uses as well). `presets::premiere()` is the whole preset.

Every entry names a FilmCraft command id. Engine commands run through `Session::execute`; UI
commands (frames, panels, monitor zoom, Project and Text panel navigation) run through
`menus::invoke`. Both are reachable by id from the CLI (`filmcraft-cli exec <id>`), the control
channel (`engine.execute` / `ui.menu.invoke`) and MCP (`command_run`).

Tests: `crates/engine/src/keyboard_tests.rs` (no key used twice in one scope; behaviour of the
keyboard commands, with undo) and `crates/ui-egui/tests/keyboard_ui.rs` (no dangling ids in the
tables, no conflicts in FilmCraft Default or the Premiere preset, keys pressed in the headless app).

## Keyboard-only commands (M3.12)

Premiere has these as keys only (most are not in a menu). Modules: `filmcraft_engine::keyboard`
(engine) and `filmcraft_ui_egui::panels::keyboard` (UI); their module docs list each id.

Existing commands that only lacked their Premiere key were added to the table too (Close, Close
Project, Import from Media Browser, Get Media File Properties, Paste Attributes, Find, Edit
Original, Make Subclip, Audio Channels, the Graphics New Layer / Arrange / Select Layer commands,
Program monitor Show Rulers / Show Guides / Snap / Lock Guides, New Bin From Selection, Paste and
Paste Insert in the Timeline, the Audio Track Mixer Loop).

FilmCraft Default keeps its own keys where they differ (Shift+E is Clip ▸ Enable there, so Export
Frame has no default key; the Premiere preset moves Shift+E to Export Frame and Enable to ⇧⌘E).

## Skipped Premiere default shortcuts

| Premiere command (key, scope) | Reason |
|---|---|
| Generative Media Tool (⇧V) | Adobe Firefly cloud generation; not part of FilmCraft. |
| Add to object / Subtract from object (⌘= / ⌘-) | Refine an AI object mask (Object Mask tool); FilmCraft has no AI object masks. |
| Change Draw Mode (⌥⌘L) | Premiere's shape draw modes for the Pen/shape tools; FilmCraft's shape tools have no draw modes. |
| Production panel: New Project, New Folder, Close Project, Make a Copy, Move Selection Home/End/Page Up/Page Down, Move To Trash, Open Project, Zoom In/Out (12 keys) | Productions (shared multi-project folders) are not implemented; there is no Production panel. |
| Search panel: Open in Source Monitor (⇧O) | No separate Search panel; Open Search (⇧⌘F) focuses the Project panel search. |
| Audio Track Mixer: Show/Hide Tracks… (⌥⌘T), Meter Input(s) Only (⌃⇧I) | The mixer has no track visibility dialog and no input metering (no hardware input recording). |
| Effect Controls: Remove Selected Effect (Delete), Loop During Audio-Only Playback (⌘L) | Effect Controls has no effect selection state and no audio-only playback mode; effects are removed from their context menu or `effects.remove`. |

| History panel: Delete (Delete) | History states cannot be selected and deleted individually. |
| Media Browser: Select Directory List / Select Media List (⇧← / ⇧→) | The directory tree and media list take no separate keyboard focus. |

| Project panel: Next/Previous Column Field, Next/Previous Row Field (Tab, ⇧Tab, Return, ⇧Return) | The list view has no inline-editable metadata cells. |
| Text panel: Edit Segment (Return) | No inline transcript text editing (corrections go through `transcript.set`). |
| Text panel: Follow Active Monitor (⇧C), Show Source Transcript (⇧Z) | Only sequence transcripts exist; source clips have no transcript view. |
